                Dear Pacha,
            </p>
            <p>
                Happy 2 years baby, I hope you've enjoyed our time together as much as I loved it.
<br><br>
Wow another year has passed huh... last year was really interesting I think. A lot of new things happened to the both of us and I think we did a pretty good job as a team dealing with all these changes.
<br><br>
I will be honest with you, at the end of 2022 coming into 2023 I cried by myself. In 2022 I was in uni with you still and we had all the time in the world to do whatever we wanted whenever we wanted. I loved how we could go everywhere on any day we wanted and we spent a lot of our time together. I knew that last year I would be starting full time work which would be a HUGE change in my life that would affect both of us because I thought that now that I have to work 5 days a week, I won't be able to do much with you. At the very start of last year I gave it my all to make our short trip to Newcastle a memorable one since it would probably be the last time we had lots of fun together...(oh but how I was so wrong about this). Starting full time work has not been as too bad as I thought it would be. I had so much to tell you about from work and you comforted me a lot and really helped me get through the really stressful times. I really hope that I have made it clear that I am not going anywhere even if I'm starting the next chapter in my life, you're coming with me no matter what because we're 2 peas in a pod. 
<br><br>
And then my dreams came true... We moved in together. My wishes to be able to see you everyday, go to sleep with you everyday and wake up to you every single day finally became reality. This was honestly the happiest I've ever been, being able to be with you and just live life with you together every day. Things weren't as simple and easygoing as I thought it would be though. I feel that we have grown together and learnt a lot through living with each other and it is all for the best. I'm just glad I haven't done anything bad enough for you to not want to live with me - I WILL DO MY BEST TO NOT LEECH ONTO YOU IN HOT WEATHER TOO MUCH BUT ITS REALLY HARD T ^T. I know I haven't gotten on my knees and said the words yet but I think I was (AND AM) so happy because of how lucky I am to be able to live with my amazing girlfriend as if we were a happy married couple ^_^, and I will continue to do my best to help out as much as I can and have FUN TOIME with you no matter where we are. Because like I've said many many times before, I don't care where we live as long as I'm with you it is all I can ask for and what truly brings me happyness. 
<br><br>
I feel that last year I have grown a lot in this relationship and in really good ways, which I only have you to thank. I know that I've hurt you a lot throughout last year and I am sorry for all those times I was mean, selfish and said things in awful ways, there is no way for me to go back and change it but I can try my best to be better moving forward. I have been thinking really hard about my feelings and emotions when it comes to you and how you help me deal with it. I want to thank you for always - and I mean always being there for me even when I'm upset at you. You always help me reflect on the bad bad ways of my thinking and behaviour and help me really get better. I really want to be better to always make sure that I'm treating you in ONLY the best ways because thats what you deserve. After thinking back at all the times we have fought I realised that it ultimately leads to me being at fault in the first place. And I am really sorry for hurting you those times, and I am grateful for you staying by my side even after all the rough times. I am so lucky and so happy to have you, someone that I can lean on when things are horrible and very appreciative that you'll always do your best to help me in any way.
<br><br>
So going back to how I was scared about last year. I think I was completely wrong. Even after all these new changes, we still have the BESTEST times together and I really don't think I would have changed anything. Even though we are apart throughout the day I don't feel like I've lost too much time with you. We come together at night and have dinner together, we have lots of fun after work, and I feel that we still make an effort to connect with each other throughout the day which I am very happy about. I know for certain that I would not be where I am without you here with me... I would be hating every single day of my life tbh. But luckily for me, I have something to look forward to after work, I have someone to look forward to every day of my life and I am really appreciative for having you with me. I'm not only talking about the fun toime, even with work, you have helped motivated me to be better and do better, I honestly would not be doing as well without you with me babe, thank you TT. 
<br><br>
These are my honest feelings about us for the past year, I really hope you've enjoyed another year with me as we continue growing together as a couple. You're probably reading this while we're on our short stay sitting in our room, POSSIBLY reading from your phone. I hope you've enjoyed this thing I've done I put a lot of work into it TEEHEEE. I know you appreciate handwritten letters but I feel that I've written you quite a bit and wanted to do something different... you know something COOL THAT ONLY I CAN DO MUHEHHEHEHE. Anyways, I love you a lot, thank you for being with me for another year. I am looking forward to what this year brings and can't wait to go on MANY MANY MORE MOOCHIE MOO AND PACHAPOO ADVENTURES.
